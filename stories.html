              </h2>
              <p>There are some days where you may need to celebrate yoruself. Some people may call it narcissism at its finest. I prefer to think of this as just an opportunity to eat cake from Chicago's chinatown. Basically I panicked when the nice chinese lady asked what I wanted to write on the cake so I just said Amy Lin. So yes, I did get a whole cake for myself and wrote my name on it. On the topic of cake, one time in freshman year of college I was facetiming my parents and I noticed my favorite cake on the kitchen counter. I asked my mom what the occasion was and when my mom flipped the ipad camera to show me, the inscription on the cake literally read "Happy empty nest"
              </p>
                </h2>
              I figure cakes can be celebrated for literally any occasion. I also think I like cake better than cupcake for some reason. Perhaps I find that cake tends to be more moist and yummy. If you can't tell, I'm a little fluffy. But back in my day, I used to run 35-42 miles a week! Now I have retired gracefully and am transitioning to a student dentist life. Check out some of my other stories-more to come!

              </h2>
              <p>Today as I was going up an elevator, I saw a little boy with a roll of stickers. I didn't think much of it while I was grocery shopping, but then I saw a huge roll of stickers when I arrived at the cash register. After he carded me for the wine I bought (probs around 5 bucks a bottle of wine), I asked if I could have stickers and the guy retorted, "how old are you?"as he gave me a nice roll of stickers. I responded 23 btw, which is wrong. I am only 22. Eitherway I now have a nice roll of Trader Joe's stickers that I am not sure what to do with but there's this cool shopping cart sticker. Maybe I'll put it on my folders when Dental School starts in September.

              </h2>
              <p>After eating 1st dinner at Din Tai Fung, my friends and I decided to walk home to capitol hill. As we were walking, we came across this gem-a lovely dented blue toyota with the the words "YOU'RE NEXT" proudly sharpied in. How nice! I have kindly blurred out the liscence plate in hopes of saving myself. I do not want to be next!

             </p> And if anyone is wondering, 1st dinner comes before 2nd dinner.

                    </h2>
                    <p> No, I am not a serial killer. I would just like to get that up on the internet in case I do not make it past TSA today. As a dental student, you are required to collect teeth for practice and learning. Today I spent the day dropping off empty Trader Joe's spaghetti jars with a 10% bleach solution to oral surgeons. I have collectd a decent amount of teeth and am going to fly home with this jar of them... My plan is to carry them with me on the plane. Mostly because I thought of sending them home via USPS, but I also needed to send my knives home and didn't want teeth and knives to be in the same package. I really don't want a conversation about what's in the package with the USPS or the PoPo. Again, I am not a serial killer. Just your friendly neighborhood dental student flying with about 100 extracted teeth.
                    </p>
                   </p> If you think flying with that is weird though, my friend Bobby told me that a lot of commercial planes carry dead corpses/organs. Apparently that's a thing. Look it up!
