              </h2>
              <p>There are some days where you may need to celebrate yoruself. Some people may call it narcissism at its finest. I prefer to think of this as just an opportunity to eat cake from Chicago's chinatown. Basically I panicked when the nice chinese lady asked what I wanted to write on the cake so I just said Amy Lin. So yes, I did get a whole cake for myself and wrote my name on it. On the topic of cake, one time in freshman year of college I was facetiming my parents and I noticed my favorite cake on the kitchen counter. I asked my mom what the occasion was and when my mom flipped the ipad camera to show me, the inscription on the cake literally read "Happy empty nest"
              </p>
              I figure cakes can be celebrated for literally any occasion. I also think I like cake better than cupcake for some reason. Perhaps I find that cake tends to be more moist and yummy. If you can't tell, I'm a little fluffy. But back in my day, I used to run 35-42 miles a week! Now I have retired gracefully and am transitioning to a student dentist life. Check out some of my other stories-more to come! </p>

              </h2>
              <p>Today as I was going up an elevator, I saw a little boy with a roll of stickers. I didn't think much of it while I was grocery shopping, but then I saw a huge roll of stickers when I arrived at the cash register. After he carded me for the wine I bought (probs around 5 bucks a bottle of wine), I asked if I could have stickers and the guy retorted, "how old are you?"as he gave me a nice roll of stickers. I responded 23 btw, which is wrong. I am only 22. Eitherway I now have a nice roll of Trader Joe's stickers that I am not sure what to do with but there's this cool shopping cart sticker. Maybe I'll put it on my folders when Dental School starts in September.
