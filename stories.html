                </h2>
                <p>So kind of an update, I started dental school and my white coat ceremony is coming up. I got stopped by TSA for having my extracted teeth. After the TSA agent confirmed with 4 other agents that it was ok, he let me pass security. As for dental school, it's a lot of information. They make an analogous to a fast moving train. We are three weeks in and one of my classmates was talking to the professor that she's got 3 seatbelts and and she's falling off. She even made the motion of clicking her seatbelt in. Fun fact, the correct way to hold a skull is NOT like a bowling ball. Do not put your fingers in the eye sockets. Here's a pic of a skull in a textbook.

                </h2>
                <p>There are some days where you may need to celebrate yourself. Some people may call it narcissism at its finest. I prefer to think of this as just an opportunity to eat cake from Chicago's chinatown. Basically I panicked when the nice chinese lady asked what I wanted to write on the cake so I just said Amy Lin. So yes, I did get a whole cake for myself and wrote my name on it. On the topic of cake, one time in freshman year of college I was facetiming my parents and I noticed my favorite cake on the kitchen counter. I asked my mom what the occasion was and when my mom flipped the ipad camera to show me, the inscription on the cake literally read "Happy empty nest"
                </p>
          <p> I figure cakes can be celebrated for literally any occasion. I also think I like cake better than cupcake for some reason. Perhaps I find that cake tends to be more moist and yummy. If you can't tell, I'm a little fluffy. But back in my day, I used to run 35-42 miles a week! Now I have retired gracefully and am transitioning to a student dentist life. Check out some of my other stories-more to come!

                <p>My mom and I were downtown and trying to catch our train. I told her we had to hurry and she exclaims “I walk fast; I’m already going top speed.” All of a sudden this nice very pregnant lady zips past her and leaves us in the dust I only managed to snap this pic cuz she stopped at a light. She’s got a backpack, her lunch, and other swag too!

                </h2>
                <p> No, I am not a serial killer. I would just like to get that up on the internet in case I do not make it past TSA today. As a dental student, you are required to collect teeth for practice and learning. Today I spent the day dropping off empty Trader Joe's spaghetti jars with a 10% bleach solution to oral surgeons. I have collectd a decent amount of teeth and am going to fly home with this jar of them... My plan is to carry them with me on the plane. Mostly because I thought of sending them home via USPS, but I also needed to send my knives home and didn't want teeth and knives to be in the same package. I really don't want a conversation about what's in the package with the USPS or the PoPo. Again, I am not a serial killer. Just your friendly neighborhood dental student flying with about 100 extracted teeth.
                </p>
             </p> If you think flying with that is weird though, my friend Bobby told me that a lot of commercial planes carry dead corpses/organs. Apparently that's a thing. Look it up!

                </h2>
                <p>Today as I was going up an elevator, I saw a little boy with a roll of stickers. I didn't think much of it while I was grocery shopping, but then I saw a huge roll of stickers when I arrived at the cash register. After he carded me for the wine I bought (probs around 5 bucks a bottle of wine), I asked if I could have stickers and the guy retorted, "how old are you?"as he gave me a nice roll of stickers. I responded 23 btw, which is wrong. I am only 22. Eitherway I now have a nice roll of Trader Joe's stickers that I am not sure what to do with but there's this cool shopping cart sticker. Maybe I'll put it on my folders when Dental School starts in September.

As we were walking, we came across this gem-a lovely dented blue toyota with the the words "YOU'RE NEXT" proudly sharpied in. How nice! I have kindly blurred out the liscence plate in hopes of saving myself. I do not want to be next!

                </h2>
                <p>This post is about how I made money from venmo by charging silly things. Essentially what this website's platform is based on.

                </p>
             </p> I downloaded venmo probably my freshman year of college. As I was messing around with the app, I realized there was a section where you could see the charge interactions of anyone who made their transactions to each other public. Most of them were uninteresting but ocassionally I'd see some petty and funny ones like charges for friendship fees. I found that pretty silly, so I started charging a few of my close friends an opporunity to renew their friendship subscription with me." At one point, I even got one of my friend's dad to pay me to continue being his daughter's friend. On a similar note, I also began charging some of my friends' boyfriends a "dating fee" to continue dating their significant other. Some of them actually agreed.
